I created this using only Html and CSS. Used just a little bootstrap for centering the contact form 
i eventually changed the contact form because i was unable to make the boxes equally aligned. so now i did a newsletter form subscribe instead. 
As you can see i eventually removed the subscribe form as well was having issues aligning and structuring it.
